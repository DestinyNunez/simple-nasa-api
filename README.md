# ðŸš€ Project: Simple NASA API

### Goal: Enable the user to enter a date and return the picture/video of the day from NASA's API

### How It's Made
I used HTML and CSS to give the website structure and style. I also used the framework flexbox for positioning the elements on the page.

Functionality: For functionality I used JavaScript and integrated NASA's photo/video of the day so that when the user enters a date the photo or video of the day will appear on the page.



I completed the challenge: 4
I feel good about my code: 4
feedback: Tips on how I could optimize my code.
